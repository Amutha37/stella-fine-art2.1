    <h3>Biography</h3>
    <br></br>
    <br></br>
    <p>Stella Kypriotis is a contemporary realist artist based in Sydney.</p>
    <br></br>
    <p>
      As a young child, Stella had a longing to create anything, she enjoyed
      making something out of nothing which gave her a sense of satisfaction.
      She would sit at her mothers sewing machine for hours at a time, and try
      to design a dress for her dolls with the left over material her mum was
      ready to scrap. Her favourite subject in school was Arts, and Stella loved
      listening to the teachers stories from the previous artist history. Her
      teacher asked the students to paint something which they felt connected
      to. Stella went on to paint a large canvas of Crying Girl, by Roy
      Lichtenstein, which was her 1st ever painting.
      <br></br> <br></br>
      During her career life she worked in various office roles, which didn't
      leave room for her creativity. She then decided to work in an Art-shop to
      help her further explore that field. Then she decided to enrol in
      art-classes with artist Christopher Vidal to learn to draw and paint in
      oils, and then she would practice for many hours a day to better her skill
      in drawing and painting.

    <h3>Artist's statement</h3>
    <p>
      <br></br> <br></br>I love painting a variety of subjects such as florals,
      wildlife, landscapes, seascapes and portraits. I use artist grade oil
      paints such as Michael Harding, Windsor and Newton, Masterclass and Art
      Spectrum or acrylics on a well prepared primed canvas or wooden panel.
      <br></br> <br></br>I love to put my heart and soul into every painting I
      do, my goal is that the viewer/collector feels connected to my paintings
      and love having them displayed in their home for generations to come. In
      our ordinary hectic life, we can miss out on seeing the beauty of our
      surroundings in nature, when I paint it gives me the opportunity to
      reflect on my subject and appreciate the beautiful life that God has given
      us on all it's form and beauty.
      <br></br> <br></br>I paint or draw in my home studio mostly every day and
      whenever possible go plein-air painting in the beautiful country Australia
      where I live and staying connected to other artists.
