          If you are interested in commissioning me to do a custom painting for
          you or a loved one, please leave your details in the contact section
          provided. I would contact you to discuss what you are considering for
          a painting, the size of your canvas, your budget and how long it
          should roughly take, (depending if I have other commission work needed
          to be completed first).
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          If you and I are both happy with the discussion and you would like to
          go ahead, I will then start on the exciting journey of your painting.
          I will keep you informed on the progress painting and will send you
          development photos along the way. On the final photo if there are any
          minor adjustments we will look at that too.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          Upon completion, I will varnish your work (minimum 2 - 4 weeks) when
          dry for longevity and then mail it to you once the final payment is
          received.
        </p>

            before starting.
